8,Templar Flats,"Symptomatic of Hamilton at the time, King William Street consisted of a mix of vacant lots, buildings slated for demolition, and struggling businesses. An empty building, vacant lot, and the would-be methadone clinic became what is now the catalytic development known as the Templar Flats. The completed project includes 25 residential units and three exciting independent restaurants along the King William streetscape. The new building has a “modest monumental” presence, clad in limestone and punctuated with large windows of simple proportions. The vintage patina is balanced by the modern glass structure that is recessed behind, providing entry to the residential lobby and extending up to the glass rooftop apartments above.

10,234 King Street East,"This retail commercial project, with a residential unit above, was a renovation effort by master carpenter Mike Haines. The new heritage inspired facade aimed to elevate the street’s appearance, draw high-end tenants and encourage property owners in the area to do the same. When designing the exterior, it was important that the renovations paid respect to the historic design of the building, and its place in the commercial row it comprises in the International Village on King Street East. The entire building uses high-efficiency LED lighting, furnaces and air-conditioners, and insulation. The original details of the building were preserved, such as exposed brick walls and coffered ceilings. Exterior brass lights and pilasters add character to the façade.

12,Waterdown Library & Civic Centre,"The Waterdown Library and Civic Centre design process began with an acknowledgement of a dramatic site upon the Niagara Escarpment. The design takes advantage of the topography, using elevation changes to provide expression and access to the different programmatic elements within the building. The design provides for a single story, split level building with the library as principle tenant. The library component hovers one story above municipal program components, connected via a series of gently sloping internal walkways. The topography is extended into the library, organized as a series of four terraces.  A large library reading atrium is situated at the high elevation providing striking views of the escarpment, and projecting the life and vitality of this exciting public program to the street, the city, and the lake beyond.

2,Confederation Beach Park Branding & Wayfinding (Phase 1),"Through the Confederation Beach Park Master Plan efforts, it was identified that one of the first steps towards the revitalization of Confederation Park was to refresh the branding and wayfinding strategy. An early audit of the site identified that there was a lack of continuity and brand consistency throughout the many different signage fixtures and messaging within the park. The re-branding exercise would improve the overall visitor experience and provide additional methods of communication. As a result of the exercise, a family of signage fixtures was developed to create an overall “sense of place” and improve the quality of the public realm.

A three-storey contemporary glass addition sits atop the structure, creating 36 residential units.  Engineering studies could not determine the structural capacity of the existing foundation. The structure of the addition had to “bypass” the existing structure. The foundation for the addition was constructed with helical piers, essentially steel screws drilled into the ground to a level of solid bearing. Steel and glass for the upper structure were selected as light and complementary materials to the visually heavier brick and stone of the original building. Noise from nearby rail line and shutning yard resulted in mitigation measures such as thicker glass, increased airspace and a layer of lamintated film.","Lintack Architects Inc., Adesso Design Inc., WEBB Planning Consultants Inc., GUPM Construction Managers",2013,Award of Excellence in Adaptive Reuse,50 Murray Street West,Hamilton,"-79.8678314,43.26590280000001,0.0"
